               <h3>KOALA</h3>
               <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear[a] (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an arboreal
            herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the 
            family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members
            of the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and 
            southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. 
            It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears
            and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in)
            and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown.
            Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than
            their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies,
            but this is disputed.</p>
            <p>The koala is classified with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families 
            (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes
            within the order Diprotodontia.[12] The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that 
            includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums.[13] The ancestors of vombatiforms
            were likely arboreal,[9] and the koala's lineage was possibly the first to branch off around
            40 million years ago during the Eocene.</p>

            <p>Koalas are mammals,During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had less
             specialised diets.[15] Some species, such as the Riversleigh rainforest koala
             (Nimiokoala greystanesi).</p>
             <strong><p>WHERE DO YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
             <p>You will find Koalas at the pen E19,right next to the Giraffes and Elephants.</p>
