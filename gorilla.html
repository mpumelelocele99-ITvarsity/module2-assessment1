               <h3>GORILLA</h3>
               <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit the 
             tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two 
            species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies.
            They are the largest living primates. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans,
            from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives
            to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
            <p>Gorillas are the largest non-human primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 metres,
            weights between 100–270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex.
            They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback.
            The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor
            morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.
            Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa.
            Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide
            range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests
            of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft).
            Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea 
            level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern 
            lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.</p>

            <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit the tropical
            forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. Eastern gorillas inhabit montane and submontane forest
            between 650 and 4,000 m (2,130 and 13,120 ft) above sea level.[35] Mountain gorillas live in
            montane forest at the higher end of the elevation range, while eastern lowland gorillas live
            in submontane forest at the lower end. In addition, eastern lowland gorillas live in montane
            bamboo forest, as well as lowland forest ranging from 600–3,308 m (1,969–10,853 ft) in
            elevation.[36] Western gorillas live in both lowland swamp forest and montane forest,
            at elevations ranging from sea level to 1,600 m (5,200 ft).[35] Western lowland gorillas
            live in swamp and lowland forest ranging up to 1,600 m (5,200 ft), and Cross River gorillas
            live in low-lying and submontane forest ranging from 150–1,600 m (490–5,250 ft).</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE DO YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <P>You will find gorillas at pen E32,right on the opposite side of the cable carts.</P>
