               <h3>PANDA</h3>
            <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5]
             also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear[6] native to South Central
             China.[1] It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name
             "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda a neighboring musteloid.
             Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,
             with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
             [7] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers,
             or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity,they may receive honey,
             eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges,or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>
            <p>The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches,
             muzzle,legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white.
            Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests
            that the bold colouring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and
            rocky habitat,[41] and that their eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another.
            [42][43] The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.
            [41] The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans.
            It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and
            expanded temporal fossa.[44][45] A 110.45 kg (243.5 lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite
            force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292.
            [citation needed] Another study had a 117.5 kg (259 lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons 
            (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.</p>

            <p>Pandas are Carnivoras,The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China,
             mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[10] As a result of farming,
            deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas
            where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.
            [11][12] A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside
            the country.[13] As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China,
            living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries.[14] Wild population estimates vary;
            one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild.</p>

            <p>You will find Pandas at the pen E27,right at the opposite side of Mo's pizza.</p>
