            <h3>MOS-PIZZA</h3>
            <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish consisting of a usually
            round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese,
            and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives,
            pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, 
            traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
            A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo</p>

            fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however,it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>
